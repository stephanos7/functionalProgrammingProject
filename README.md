# [Functional Programming in JavaScript][published url]

## Instructor: [Jason Rhodes][instructor url]

Learn the basics of functional programming in JavaScript. You'll take a small, mostly imperative website and refactor it using practical declarative and functional concepts. You'll learn about pure functions, side-effects and declarative style while building a small functional utility library that will demonstrate how Underscore or Lodash functions like `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` really work. Focused on practical understanding over philosophy, this is a great basic intro to functional programming that will prepare you for deeper exploration.

The source files include a basic skeleton of the course's example project so you can follow along with the course. Named branches provide snapshots of the code at the end of each lesson, so you can compare your work to the instructor's.
